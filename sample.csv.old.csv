    generally speaking i agree with you , but that directory is somewhat different . there is code in it which we don't generate during our build process , but it's been in git since the beginning of i have no idea why that directory named 'generated' . it's quite misleading . please take a closer look before making a judgement . , bot} , bot} , user afine commented on the issue:

     
    i agree with that directory exists , it is currently in version control , and i don't think any generated files actually end up there . my guess is that it is there purely for historical reasons and to contain the rcc.jj file . in other words , i don't think your change to the gitignore will impact that directory . according to the gitignore documentation    
    > if the pattern does not contain a slash git treats it as a shell glob pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location of the  . gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not from a  . gitignore file) . since there are not any top level files called `generated` i don't think this line in the gitignore has any impact on the repository . am i -2 something here ? , bot} , bot} , user commented on the issue:

     
    hi folks,
    
    sorry for not keeping up with the jira . - thanks for the and others for reviewing . here are some info - hope it will shed some clarity . - there exists in the code a dir named: src/java/main/org/apache/jute/compiler/generated
    - in that dir it has rcc.java and other files
    - files in that dir is required to for successful compilation
    
    - however , the  . gitignore has the keyword ""generated""
    - when i add the source code tree into out company repo , the was effectively ignored - and thus not added into our company repo
    - i ran a jenkins job to compile the code from the repo - it failed - due to the missing rcc and other required java sources under that excluded directory . when i did a git status - everything was in sync even though my workspace has the rcc.java - but my company repo actually is missing that dir . my local compile succeeds every time . but jenkins job compile using company repo always fails . after some comparison - then i noticed the -2 dir on the company repo side . once i removed the generated keyword from the  . gitignore - git immediately detected the generated dir in my workspace as new . i was able to git to make the jenkins compile successful . hope this help clarify the situation . i prefer to have generated keyword removed . in the future , if the compile will generate artifacts that should be ignored , then modify the  . gitignore and rename the dir - so the does not conflict . my cents . thanks

 , bot} , bot} , user anmolnar commented on the issue:

     
    in the other way around: if there's no at the beginning of the keyword , git will check the entire path relative to the root for the string `generated` and if it finds a match , it'll ignore all files underneath . my suggestion is to remove `generated` keyword from  . gitignore - like in this - , because 'real' generated folders are already excluded explicitly . there could be other possible solutions to the problem , i'm open to them . , bot} , bot} , ","2, -3"
